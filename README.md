Overview

This website is for any contemporary music enthusiast and will provide them with direct links to singer-songwriters of the Nordic Music industry.

Why does it exist

There are many artists in the Nordic region who create their music in the English language, however the marketing strategies of their record labels often do not extend properly into the global market. This website will act as a relay for the artists to introduce their music to a wider audience, especially in Europe and the US.

What does it do?

The site will provide some biographical information for each artist, with links to their work provided through YouTube and spotify links, and also direct links to the artists' social media pages.
